# ArduinoSandbox
A development sandbox of Arduino code

## MatrixIntro_cs
A fork of the MatrixIntro sketch that is shipped with the Arduino R4 Uno board to demo the 96-LED matrix and built-in status LED.

## servo_sandbox
Just some basic servo control code to help learn some servo basics.
(tip: use the same power supply for the servo and the arduino board so you don't facepalm...)
